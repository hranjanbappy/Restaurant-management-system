'''
A restaurant management system that generates bill (with discount) per order. 
The rules for the discount are given below: 
(1) If a customer is younger than 25 years, he/she gets a 15% discount on all products on his/her birthday. 
(2) If a customer is older than 60 years, he/she gets a 30% discount on all products on his/her birthday. 
(3) For the rest of the customers, they get a 5% discount on their birthday. 
(4) There is a 20% discount on pasta regardless of the customerâ€™s date of birth. 
(6) Only the largest discount can be applied to any item if there are multiple discounts.
